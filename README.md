# Sample Novel Game

## Sample application of a novel game developed with SwiftUI
It is a novel game developed with SwiftUI. This application was created to test the logic that makes up a novel game.
Eventually, we plan to develop a library called StellaUI so that these logics can be easily implemented.
If you have a feature you need or would like to contribute to the project, please send us a pull request.
